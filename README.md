# AI-Powered Proposal Website

This repository contains the code for a fun and interactive proposal website.  It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a multi-step animation leading up to a proposal message, with "Yes" and "No" button options.  A "success" page is displayed if the user clicks "Yes," and a "failure" page with a feedback form is shown if they click "No."

## Features

* **Engaging Animation:** A multi-step animation guides the user through a lighthearted "AI love protocol" process before revealing the proposal.
* **Customizable Name:** The name displayed in the proposal message can be easily customized in the HTML.
* **Interactive Buttons:**  "Yes" and "No" buttons provide a clear choice for the user.
* **Success and Failure Pages:**  Distinct pages are displayed based on the user's choice.
* **Feedback Form (Failure):** The "No" response leads to a feedback form, allowing the user to provide input.  This currently just links to a phone number; you'll likely want to change this.
* **Responsive Design:** The website is designed to be responsive and work well on different screen sizes (though further testing and refinement are always recommended).
